# NutNet paper draft 5 to-do

- change x-axis in Fig 1 to Nsupply
- create site-level table to go with Fig 2
	- remove this figure?
- change figure 3 and 7 to bar plots with means and SEM (good idea Eric!)
- Change Figure 7 y-axis label to g m-2
- cld for Fig 7
- Figure 8: color other than grey?

- add +µ to Figure 3

- more discussion of other nutrients in intro (or methods)
- more discussion of N fixers and C4/C3 in intro (or methods)

- why both 19 and 26 sites mentioned? check with Risa

- mention how isotopes were measured

- remove light conversion because tall/dominant plants? I dunno

## new setup (ugh!)

### goals
1. Quantify the impact of soil nitrogen on carbon costs to acquire N (β) across a climate gradient.
	- should we include soil water?
2. Assess the impacts of biomass responses on this response.
3. Assess the connection between change in β and changes in χ and Nmass.
